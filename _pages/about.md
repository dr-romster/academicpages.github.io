I am a clinical lecturer (practising doctor and research scientist) in intensive care medicine at the University of Cambridge, UK. I am investigating subtypes of critically unwell patients by combing the information from multi-omic studies with clinical data. 

Integrated informatics

My primary interest is integration of clinical with biological information to describe the processes taking place in critically unwell patients. In severe critical illness the clinical investigations that treating teams use are unable to characterise patients sufficiently to know whether they will benefit from an intervention. This is apparent from the repeated failures of randomised controlled trials to show benefit to patients in critical illness syndromes like sepsis and ARDS. Understanding the underlying biology of different groups of patients with critical illness will enable treating clinicians to intervene in a more targetted and precise way. Patients stand to benefit from treatments that they are more likely to respond to and avoid treatments that they are unlikely to benefit from. 

Understanding the biological processes in heterogenous groups of patients may also enable the development of new therapies that might be directed in a more targeted manner than current approaches to management of critical illness.
