I am a clinical lecturer (practising doctor and research scientist) in intensive care medicine at the University of Cambridge, UK. I am investigating the subtypes of severe respiratory failure in patients on intensive care. 

Integrated informatics
======
My primary interest is integration of clinical and biological information to describe the processes taking place in critically unwell patients. In severe critical illness the clinical investigations that treating teams use are unable to characterise patients sufficiently to know whether they will benefit from an intervention. This is apparent from the repeated failures of randomised controlled trials to show benefit to patients in criticall illness syndromes like sepsis and ARDS. Understanding the underlying biology of different groups of patients with critical illness will enable us to intervene in a more targetted and precise way. Patients will benefit from treatments that they are more likely to respond to and avoid treatments that they may be more likely to suffer adverse affects from.

To get an idea about the underlying biology of these very complex patients I use the data from measured proteins (biomarkers), gene expression and routine clinical measurements to try and characterise critically unwell patients.
